# Energy-Prediction
A smart device doesnâ€™t automatically conserve energy. Smart bulbs for example, which automate lighting when we walk into a room. Smart devices use energy to listen to and interpret commands. The question is whether it lies in convenience or energy consumption. A lot of intelligent devices are seemingly inconsequential but can make a massive difference in the energy bill.

# Goal
The goal of this portfolio is to predict the energy usage of a house based on Internet of Things (IoT) measurements of temperature and humidity and weather observations.

# Introduction
Calculating energy consumption in residential areas is explained by number of occupants and electrical appliances used by them. Using these devices leave back traceable signals in the vicinity of the device such as temperature, humidity, vibrations, light and noise. Linear models have been used to predict the energy consumed based on different data sources and environment parameters.

# Data
